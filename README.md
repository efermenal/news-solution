# News App

## Overview

A very simple news app built with Kotlin, some Android Jetpack components and MVVM pattern. The API is provide by [News API] (the API key was stored in gradle.properties). This project is not finished yet and it is part of exercises performed by me to exercise my skills from internet examples.

## Tech

The News App uses:

* [Live Data] - An observable data holder class lifecycle-aware.
* [Coroutines] -  A concurrency design pattern  that executes asynchronously.
* [Retrofit] - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* [Dagger2] - A compile-time dependency injection framework for Java, Kotlin, and Android.
* [Glide] - A media management and image loading framework for Android.
* [Room] - A persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
* [Navigations Components] - A library to implement navigation.
